                    <h1>Cultural Considerations</h1>
                    <p>It's also important to consider the various cultural factors that may influence a student's perception and understanding of academic integrity.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Academic Integrity at UNF</h2>
                    <p>Here at UNF, we are located in Canada and, therefore, adhere to Western ideals of what academic integrity means and standards for upholding it. The way we view academic integrity and the rules we maintain here in Canada are by no means universal across the world; this means that before we get into a conversation about standards for academic integrity, we have to set the stage from a cultural perspective.</p>
                    <h3>Western Assumptions</h3>
                    <p>Western educational institutions typically hold generalized assumptions regarding appropriate academic conduct. This becomes a problem when it's taken for granted that every student in the classroom arrives already familiar with these assumptions.</p>
                    <!-- START JUMBOTRON -->
                    <div class="jumbotron">
                        <p>When it is assumed that all students have the same understanding of academic integrity, the natural inclination is to conclude that examples of academic misconduct, like missing citations, unauthorized student collaboration, etc., are deliberate acts of academic dishonesty.</p>
                    </div>
                    <!-- END JUMBOTRON -->
                    <p>Sometimes, students do deliberately engage in academic dishonesty, knowing the "rules" or guidelines and choosing to ignore them. In other cases, students may be genuinely unaware that their behaviour may be regarded as dishonest. Cultural factors play a significant role in student perception of academic integrity.</p>

                                <h4>For Example</h4>
                                <p>What is thought of as "common knowledge" will often differ between cultures. What one student may view as part of the common knowledge pool, another student (or even professor) may view as specialist information that should be referenced.</p>

                    <h3>Differences Between Cultures</h3>
                    <p>Additionally, in many cultures, collaborative work is the norm, whereas in Western institutions, group work must be specified and sanctioned for a specific project. Often, if group work is not sanctioned, it is viewed as cheating or unauthorized collaboration. </p>
                    <p>Research tells us that students in collectivist cultures, like much of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are more tolerant toward cheating than western-raised students because helping fellow students during things like exams and projects is accepted and sometimes encouraged; students are meant to work together to accomplish challenging tasks.</p>
                    <p>It's important to acknowledge that cultural differences do affect perceptions of academic integrity. Because UNF is a Canadian university, we'll be discussing academic integrity in a Canadian context in this module.</p>
                    <p>In short, cultural considerations address issues such as:</p>
