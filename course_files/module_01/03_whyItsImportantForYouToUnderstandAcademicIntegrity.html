                    <h1>Why It’s Important for You to Understand Academic Integrity</h1>
                    <p>First, we need to understand why it's so important for students to understand academic integrity. Ask yourself the following questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Why do you have to learn about and understand academic integrity and misconduct?</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>What does it mean with regard to your learning?</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Increasing Your Capacity to Get a Job &amp; Gain Respect</h2>
                    <p>Well, one of the most important aspects of academic integrity that you should understand is that our Academic Integrity Policy here at UNF was created not as a way to punish students, but as a way to protect students and their futures after graduating from our university. As a whole, it is important that, as an academic community of learners, we are mindful that we're putting good systems in place to protect students and to protect the quality of the programs we are offering. </p>
                    <p>Academic integrity isn't just about students; it's about all of us as a UNF community, and these structures are put in place to protect you and to verify the validity of our programs and the capabilities of our graduates.</p>
                    <!-- START JUMBOTRON -->
                    <div class="jumbotron">
                        <p>If UNF graduates don't understand the value of academic integrity, it may lead to a negative perception of the university and its graduates, making it difficult for students to get jobs and be respected in their industry. This is part of UNF's commitment to you and your studies.</p>

                                    <p>Academic misconduct compromises the learning environment. Shortcut solutions like plagiarism, cheating, and academic dishonesty deprive students of learning opportunities. Presumably, you're here at UNF to learn and to further your education to improve your opportunities in the future. When submissions are not your own work, you're losing the opportunity to practice the concepts that you have been taught. You're also losing the opportunity to receive accurate feedback from your instructor on the work, so there is no evaluation of learning happening. </p>
                                    <p>When your submissions are not your own, it's impossible for instructors to get an accurate picture of the achievement of learning outcomes. It also limits the instructor's ability to provide constructive feedback on your work, further limiting student development and learning. </p>
                                    <p>When you engage in academic misconduct, whether intentionally or not, you are compromising your learning.</p>
