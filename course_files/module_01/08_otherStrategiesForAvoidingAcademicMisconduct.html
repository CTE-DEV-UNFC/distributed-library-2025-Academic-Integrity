                    <h1>Other Strategies for Avoiding Academic Misconduct</h1>
                    <p>You’ve learned about some key strategies for avoiding academic misconduct, specifically proper referencing and citation, paraphrasing and summarizing, understanding expectations, and managing your time. Some other strategies you can employ include exercising caution in collaboration and group work, managing academic materials responsibly, asking for clarification, and ensuring you submit your own work always.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Exercise Caution in Collaboration &amp; Group Work</h2>
                    <p>When you are working together with groups of people it is important to exercise caution to ensure that you avoid academic misconduct and remember to always submit your own work.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                                        <p>You should also be careful when sharing your work with fellow classmates and others. Working too closely with a friend or classmate on an assignment that was meant to be completed individually can lead to a violation of academic integrity. Exercising caution in the sharing of information helps to prevent accidental academic misconduct. </p>
                                        <p>While you're encouraged to work with others to further your own understanding of course concepts and idea share, you shouldn't be working together to complete assignments unless you have specifically been instructed to.</p>
                                        <p>Rember, if a classmate or friend has a question, you can try to help, but don't give them the answer.</p>

                                        <p>You should also be careful when sharing your work with fellow classmates and others. Exercising caution in the sharing of information helps to prevent accidental academic misconduct in your submissions. </p>
                                        <p>Don't ever submit work under your name that is not your own. This includes asking someone else to complete your assignments and/or tests for you, asking generative AI tools to complete your work for you, and using websites that offer pre-prepared papers in place of writing a paper yourself. Any work that you hand in for credit must be your own, original submission.</p>

                                        <p>When you're working with a group to complete an assignment, your entire submission should adhere to the academic integrity standards of your institution. This is why it's important to take special precautions when submitting group work. </p>
                                        <p>Often, from an academic integrity perspective, it is safest to complete group work together rather than dividing the assignment into parts and completing them individually, then compiling the parts into one whole document. If you divide the assignment up between group members, it becomes difficult to discern whether or not your group members have used unauthorized sources and/or assistance on their work, putting your whole group at risk for academic misconduct. </p>
                                        <p>If you work collaboratively to complete assignment tasks, you will learn to work with others, will increase your collaborative learning capacity, and will protect yourself from potential academic misconduct.</p>

It is always better to ask for help than to risk academic misconduct, whether it is intentional or not. Your instructors are there to support you in your learning and can provide guidance on assignment expectations and course work. If you aren't sure, ask! </p>
