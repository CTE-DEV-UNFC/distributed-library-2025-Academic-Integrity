                    <h1>Types of Academic Misconduct: Cheating &amp; Academic Dishonesty</h1>
                    <p>So, what are some types of Academic Misconduct that you may encounter as a student?</p>
                    <p>For the purposes of this module, we'll discuss five primary types of academic misconduct: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Cheating, </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Academic dishonesty, </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Fabrication, </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Re-use of work, </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Plagiarism.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>But what do all of these terms actually mean?</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Cheating</h2>
                    <p>The University of Niagara Falls Canada defines cheating as, </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"An act of deception by which a student misrepresents that he or she has mastered information on an assignment, test, project, or other academic exercise. This can also include assisting another student in misrepresenting their mastery of course information."</p>
                        <footer>
                            <cite>
                                <figcaption>UNF Academic Integrity and Honesty Policy (2023)</figcaption>
                            </cite>
                        </footer>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>This means that any time a student gives a false account of their understanding of concepts in any academic task, it may be considered academic misconduct in the form of cheating. Additionally, students are not permitted to help another student to misrepresent their own knowledge.</p>

                    <h3>Cheating with GenAI</h3>
                    <p>Some additional examples of cheating include the use of generative artificial intelligence tools to complete assignments and/or tests for you. When you are considering using generative AI tools to assist in the completion of your academic work, there are two key considerations you should think about:</p>
                    <ol class="box-number list-colour-one">

                        <li>
                            Do you have permission to use the tool for your intended purpose from your instructor?
                        </li closedInLi>

                        <li>
                            How can you utilize generative AI tools to add value to your learning rather than take away from your learning?
                        </li closedInLi>

                    </ol>
                    <p>If your use of GenAI tools does not meet these two consideration standards, you may be at risk for academic misconduct. Ensure that your engagement with generative AI tools is consistent with course expectations and that you are mindful that you are using the tool responsibly to assist in your learning and academic output.</p>
                    <h3>Cheating with Purchased Papers</h3>
                    <p>It is also cheating to purchase pre-prepared or custom prepared papers that have been written by someone else and submit them as your own work for academic credit. Presumably, you are enrolled in classes to increase your learning and develop your understanding of the topics being studied. If GenAI tools or other people are doing work for you, then you're not engaging in the learning yourself and you put yourself at risk for academic misconduct allegations.</p>

                    <h2>Academic Dishonesty</h2>
                    <p>Another form of academic misconduct is academic dishonesty. The University of Niagara Falls Canada defines academic dishonesty as, </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"Tampering with grades and taking part in obtaining or distributing any part of a test".</p>
